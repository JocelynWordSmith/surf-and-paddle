The homework we were given on day 2 was to recreate a design we were given in HTML and CSS with pixel perfect accuracy.
I spent a couple of nights on this project but had everything exact, and added responsive overlays to the images near
the bottom. While it's not responsive to the point of scaling properly to mobile devices, it doesn't break either. I was 
happy with how this turned out considering it was my first time really doing CSS, and only my second time doing HTML.
